# Pasta Helper - tracker
DECO2017 Assessment 3 from Ziwei Huang


## Overview
Pasta Helper is a straightforward single-page application that enables users to keep track of the pasta dishes they cook. This application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and employs 'Local Storage' for data persistence.

### Version control
This project uses github for tracking changes and managing development. Please see the github repository here:  https://github.com/DonaldHuang-usyd/DECO2017_Web_App_Prototype_ZHUA0501.git


## Features

- **Pasta Dish Record**: This feature allows users to log each pasta dish they cook, detailing the type of pasta and ingredients used.

- **Recipe Recommendation**: The app recommends a recipe when users select a specific type of pasta. An image of the dish is provided for preview.

- **Ingredient Options**: When logging each dish, users can add the ingredients used. This helps track the amount of proteins , vegetables or other ingredients used in their meals.

- **Dish Record History**: Users can revisit and track their past dishes under the 'History' tab. They also have the option to delete existing dish records.


## Setup

No setup is required

## Usage

After unzipping the file, open the 'public' folder and launch the 'index.html' file with a live server on VS Code. The web app will then successfully run on Google Chrome.

Once you've opened the page, click on the 'Let's cook some pasta!' button each time you want to log a dish or meal. After selecting a type of pasta, you'll see a recommended recipe to follow. An image of the corresponding dish will also be shown on the side, or at the bottom of the screen for mobile users.

You can log the ingredients you used in your pasta by clicking on the 'Ingredients' buttons for preset options. If you want to remove an ingredient, you want to do so.

After you click on the 'Submit' button, your record will appear under the 'History' tab and the current form will be cleared and reset.

You can view your dish record under the 'History' tab. Use the arrows to navigate through your past cooking history. If you want to remove any records, simply click the 'Delete' button.

## Limitation
This single-page web application is in the early stages of its prototype and offers limited functionality. 

Currently, it provides only a limited range of pasta types, ingredients, and recipes for users to choose from. However, more variety can be added in future development to enhance user options.

### AI usage Acknowledgment
This project was built based on the starter pack “abcd1234-track” provided by the unit tutor from DECO2017.

This project was developed with the help of the generative AI tool, ChatGPT4. The prototype's idea originated from my A2 assessment. Throughout the development process, I utilized ChatGPT4 for learning and sought its assistance for debugging when I encountered difficulties.

Here is some of the example prompts I used:

- Please teach me how to add option box by clicking a button on a webpage.
- My elements on my page seem out of space, please help me debug my code.
- Please generate some recipe for the following pasta type.
- I tried to set up a carousel to display my image upon clicking the arrow, but seems not working. Please teach me how to achieve my goal, here is the code I tried to run.
